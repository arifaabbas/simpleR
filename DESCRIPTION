Description: This package is a interactive experience where a person with zero R experience is able to import a dataset,
    view the dataframe and variables, detect missing data, get summary statistics, remove/keep variables, rename variables, 
    change class of a variable, recode variable values and conduct an in-depth multiple regression with easy to understand 
    summaries. This is done all in the console as the user selects different options in an interactive way.
