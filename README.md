# SimpleR

👍👍👍👍👍👍

## *Goal of simpleR*

The goal of simpleR is to provide a user with zero R experience ways to import a dataset, view the dataframe and variables, detect missing data, get summary statistics, remove/keep variables, rename variables, change class of a variable, recode variable values and conduct an in-depth multiple regression with easy to understand explanations of the regression output. This is all done in the console as the user selects different options in an interactive way! No coding experience needed!
